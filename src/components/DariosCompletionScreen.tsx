  1: ">>>>Reminder: All Operation Rose information is CLSFYD. \n This is a true story. \n And now, you’re a part of it. \n >>Begin transmission \n In November 1947, a famous Canadian journalist called Lionel Shapiro found blueprints that described an electromagnetic rocket was being developed in Marbella, Spain – my hometown. \n I’ve been obsessively studying this story, ignored for over 80 years, since the fateful day I found it on 12 May 2022. \n I’ve now reached out to all the historians who tried to figure it out already. Some were dead. Others told me it was a ghost story – that the KM-2 rocket didn’t exist. That it was a pointless search.\n But that didn’t stop me. It fuelled me. \n Because I knew otherwise. Not based on investigative certainties. But because I remember. \n I remembered how on the day I discovered Lionel Shapiro’s article my heart sang like a canary, in tonalities of both danger and promise. \n That day, as I dived into research online, my mind abuzz with investigative leads, the hours started to feel like minutes. By nightfall, I’d amassed a dossier of compelling clues. \n Stepping outside, exhilarated, I thought: “perhaps I’m going to make a difference after all”. \n Suddenly, my surroundings turned an intense green. I turned around instantly. \n The skies had answered in a comet of blue, green and violet that streaked across the horizon before falling to earth, broken into glowing pieces. \n Laying in shock, I had to dismiss the first thought: “the stars moved for me”. Too egotistical. \n I remembered the words from Game of Thrones: “stars don’t move for men, boy.” \n Then I realised the stars couldn’t have moved for me. But that, perhaps, I had moved with the stars. \n Because maybe, just maybe, this mystery is what I was born to resolve. Not because of the enigma itself - plenty of those have come and gone in history. \n Instead, it forced me to realise that mysteries are always too big to solve alone. That, perhaps, their role (and their goal) is to bring people together. \n That's why I created this CLSFYD project. And it's's why you're reading this text right now - you've passed the first filter. Because, above all, the CLSFYD project selects agents who are curious. They have to be be honest. Thoughtful. And, crucially, they must listen to their hearts and bodies. \n This could be you. If it is, I want to present you the gift of an unresolved mystery. The taste of true adventure. The thrill of discovering something heretofore unknown. \n Once we solve this, we will find other investigations. And solve them. Together. Marbella is just the first step. To hone the investigative machine. \n CLSFYD is the beginning of a global mystery guild. A network of investigators like you, who chase the truth for what it is: treasure. Archive rooms, mine shafts, palaces – they’re all waiting for us to explore them. \n CLSFYD will span the world, united in love and devotion to the truth. \n But it won’t be enjoyed sitting down. This online game is just the bait. It will catch the curious, prove their ability, and test their appetite for more. \n Because this guild of investigators realises this world is a game waiting to be played. \n A world where they can meet like-minded people intent on enjoying and discovering this gift we call life to the fullest. \n That’s why the real CLSFYD will be oragnised over email, text message and phone, but take place outside. \n Because the Great Game of power, which CLSFYD will translate to history and participate in, takes place in real life. \n And so will CLSFYD. \nInterested?",
  2: ">>begin transmission \n The key to History’s future isn’t just the discovery of past truths. \n Pondering the past makes the now seem almost intangible. \n If you’re not careful in the textual truth’s pursuit, life and youth will slip by. \n I was determined that this wouldn’t happen to me. \n So, I started creating. I started making. \n Not some software. Not an app. I wanted to get away from current incarnations of enjoyment. That’s why this is a simple webpage. And it’s why, once you solve this, the game will move offline. \n I was creating a real adventure. \n But that wasn’t enough. I wanted to bring it to the physical. Create something that, being held, manifested my intention to enjoy this gift of life. \n That’s why I created the CLSFYD Accessories. \n Now there’s something I can hold which reminds me of a commitment to live life as it was meant to be enjoyed: in the now. \n Something I can feel in my pocket and smile about; a reminder I’ve left the house knowing I will create these positive externalities. \n Because that’s all there is to life – a powerful knowledge of what is will bring that is to you. \n As you can imagine, it worked. \n And it’s only the beginning. \n Because at CLSFYD, we’re obsessed with adventures through historical truths. \n That’s why our first product is about sex: because sex was the world's first product and profession. \n And it’s why our second product is a game that emphasises History. This is lesser known, but logic dictates the world’s second profession was that of a historian: Binga slept with Bongo for two peanuts and she wouldn’t sleep with me for three – the bitch.",
  3: ">>Reminder, All Operation Rose information is CLSFYD. \n I'd congratulate you for passing this stage. \n But if you're of the chosen few, it was a breeze to complete. \n So I won't. \n>begin transmission. \n I grew up in Marbella. Chances are, you've heard of it. A city of luxurious parties and villas, prestigious hotels and restaurants. \n But that's just the surface. \n Dig deeper, like I have, and you'll realise Marbella is no city at all. \n It's a cover story. \n One that obscures the Costa del Sol's true economic asset: silence. \n Because Marbella is no ordinary town, but the parking spot for the world's 'black income', an international WeWork of organised crime, and former corporate retreat of the Western Black Empire. \n One man lies at the core of why Marbella became the city is is today. \n His enemies called him a traitor. His wife called him Papi. His close friends, Nicodemus. His living descendants call him a hero, one who knew when to betray Hitler. \n History knows him as Prince Maximilian von Hohenlohe. \n But I call him the Rocket Prince. \n From 1944 to 1946, the Rocket Prince arrived in Marbella. The official reasons and timeline are hazy. Shortly thereafter, he purchased the Finca San Margarita which his son Alfonso would later develop into the Marbella Club Hotel. \n If you had visited Marbella in the 1950s, you'd have bumped into its regulars like Frank Sinatra, Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly or Shaun Connery. \n The Marbella Club founded superficial Marbella as we know it. Exclusive and glamorous, jovial and care-free. \n But the Rocket Prince founded Marbella's depths, too. \n Not only was Mazimilian a spy for the notorious SD intelligence arm of the SS. Nor was he only a double agent for his old friend and CIA founder, Allen Dulles, codenamed 515. He was also the chief executive of the Waffen-Union Skoda-Brun company in Madrid, Spain. \n Ever heard of the Nazi Bell? There’s a reason why its investigators, Igor Witkowski and Nick Cook, pointed to Skoda-Brun as its originator: they were the SS’s primary rocket development arm. \n If anyone in Spain had access to blueprints about secretive, exotic rocket development projects, it was Maximilian. What are the odds that Shapiro wrote they were being built in just the town he settled towards the end of the war? \n Very low. \n But the odds get even lower. \n The difficulty is finding the smoking gun to prove it. \n That's where you will come in. \n But not if you can't handle the next stage.   ",
  4: ">>begin transmission \n The secret to investigations is that your methodology matters little. Your toolset is secondary. \n Investigations must follow the heart. Only it knows the future, the past and present. It knows where the bodies are buried, where the secrets lie. \n Your brain, toolset and methodology only get you to an objective your heart has already visualised. \n If you listen to your heart, much of the world's complexities can be washed away. \nThe heart always reaches the signal through the noise. The mind always struggles. \n That's another reason for this CLSFYD project: the best investigators are no investigators at all. They're chefs, nurses, doctors and investment bankers. \n Few who listen to their hearts could ever become professional investigators - because it's a rotten profession. \n The best investigators are the electricians who can smell a burned wire, a nurse who can feel the source of the pain, a banker who knows where to put his client's money. \n And that's why you're here. Because you can smell I'm giving you something real. \n Because you could be a true investigator - you just didn't know it.  ",
  5: ">>Reminder: All Operation Rose information is CLSFYD. \n >>Begin transmission \n But the Rocket Prince isn’t the only obvious clue. \n The next one towers above the city like a protective sphinx. It grants Marbella a distinctly temperate weather, protecting it from the worst thunder and rainstorms, contributing to its paradise-like ambiance. \n Locals call the mountain La Concha. \nI call it The Marbella Rose. \nUnderneath it lies our next clue: the Marbella Minerals. \n Because Marbella’s Rose holds almost all the minerals an electromagnetic rocket factory should hope for. \n It holds magnesium, like the Swedish investigators of the Ghost Rocket crashes estimated those mysterious low-flying rockets were made of. Ilmenite titanium and chromium nickel, necessary to make the Nitinol material developed by the Battelle Memorial Institute, which researchers have alleged received materials from the Roswell crash. \n And, above all, it holds magnetite – lots of it. That’s right, Shapiro wrote the electromagnetic rocket was made in a city that hosts a mountain essentially made of magnets. \n What are the odds? \n And here’s where the investigation becomes a mystery. Because if you follow the records, all trail of mining activity vanishes from the years 1936 to 1949. \n Weird, right? \nIt could be a case of mistaken identity. A red herring. Or perhaps the electromagnetic rocket doesn’t even need the minerals I’ve described above. \nI’ve thought of all these possibilities. \nBut everything else I found keeps persistently pointing the needle back to Marbella. \nAbsent local evidence be damned. \nAre you seeing the picture yet? \nThe closer you get to the heart of this mystery the more information seems to disappear. \nThat’s why I need you. \nBecause I’m in Marbella – but you’re not.",
